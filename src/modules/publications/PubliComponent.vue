Five different water sources were analysed and passed through the laterite based geopolymer matrices filters (LBGMF). Bacteriological analysis was used to assess the efficiency of the LBGMF. The filters were obtained by altering laterite with different percentages of RHA as 0, 10, 20, 30, 40.wt%. ',

    abstract: 'Most investigations in the literature concerning cement replacement with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) have predominantly focused on the utilization of fly ash and slag, which are not universally available.

    abstract: 'The present study investigated the influence of the replacement of waste clay bricks (WB) by volcanic scoria (Zg) on the fresh and hardened properties of geopolymer binders for potential construction applications at ambient temperature. Geopolymer paste samples were prepared using Zg as raw material blended with WB ranging from 0 to 50 wt% of total raw materials. Alternative alkaline activator used for the geopolymer synthesis was prepared by mixing rice husk ash (RHA) and 6 mol/L of NaOH solution.',

    abstract: 'Geopolymerization, a sustainable route to advanced binders, has traditionally been explored using common activators and single precursors such as metakaolin. Although previous investigations have explored the potential of feldspathic minerals, particularly with metakaolin as a partial replacement, there remains a gap in understanding the nuances of feldspar-phosphate-based geopolymers.',
